Weather Application Using Openweathermap.org API

This was a semester project to utilize JavaScript and an API. I decided to make a simple weather application that would allow a person to get their weather information either by zip code or by browser location. The entire site is contained in a simple HTML page with the weather card hidden until the weather search is performed. Depending on the weather temperature, the weather card will have an outer glow to reflect colder and warmer temperatures. If the current weather is a thunderstorm, the weather card will flash with a lightning effect.
